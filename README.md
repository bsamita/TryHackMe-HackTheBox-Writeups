## My Methodology

Every write-up follows a structured SOC analyst approach:

1. **Reconnaissance** — enumerate the environment before taking any action
2. **Observation** — understand normal behaviour before introducing attack conditions
3. **Execution** — document commands, tools, and outcomes precisely
4. **Analysis** — map findings to real-world attack patterns and frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK)
5. **Defensive Response** — conclude with practical mitigations applicable in enterprise environments
